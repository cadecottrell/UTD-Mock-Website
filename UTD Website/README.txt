In an effort to avoid plagarism, I did use facts/information from the UTD site and the Photos/Gifs from the UTD site, and UTD associated Flickr/Giphy Accounts.

I couldnt find anything on the assignment stating that we couldnt use filler text. 
I kept this at a minimum and only used filler 2 times, to make the site look prettier.


Thank you!
